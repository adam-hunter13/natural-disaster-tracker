## 3-Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was getting the NASA API to work. The NASA API was not connecting as I came close to finishing the project. Throughout the project the API had been responsive but when it came time to deploy and showcase, no pionts were being identified on the map. After attempting to contact NASA to see if they had any idea why the API was no longer working, I attempted to change my fetch requests to axios requests, but still provided no success. Evently I was able to get everything working by trying various things and online resources.
